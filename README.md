## Downloading datasets
To download the CHAOS dataset from [the CHAOS challenge website](https://chaos.grand-challenge.org/Download/) 
Then, you need to create a folder structure as described.
## Training networks
To train TarGAN on CHAOS, run the training script below. 

```bash
# Train TarGAN using the CHAOS dataset

# Test TarGAN using the CHAOS dataset

```

To train TarGAN on your own dataset, create a folder structure in the same format as and run the command:

```bash
# Train TarGAN on custom datasets

# Test TarGAN on custom datasets

```
## Using pre-trained networks
To download a pre-trained model checkpoint, run the script below. The pre-trained model checkpoint will be downloaded and saved into `./pre-trained/models` directory.

```bash

```
